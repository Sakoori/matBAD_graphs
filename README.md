# matBAD_graphs
Graphing scripts for MATLAB because I'm bad and can't figure out matplotlib to save my life.

These scripts are either crated in 2018b or 2020a. 2018b uses the outdated subplot function (it got replaced with something else in 2019a, but newer versions can still compile the code).

Scripts are organized based on usage (scripts for AIMD analysis, bar graphs, random plots, etc.).

I made these just so I could plot things and avoid using Excel's awful graphing features. I'm sure I can convert these into something using matplotlib, but I am very bad at programming and MATLAB is the only language I know how to use.

Feel free to use/modify any of the scripts. I just use GitHub to store everything so i don't have to keep switching computers every time I do something.
